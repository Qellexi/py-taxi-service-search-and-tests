+# Сheck Your Code Against the Following Points
+
+## Don't Push db files
+
+Make sure you don't push db files (files with `.sqlite`, `.db3`, etc. extension).
+
+## Don't forget to attach all screenshots of created/modified pages.
+
+## Code Efficiency
+1. Use `UserCreationForm` while creating user.
+
+Good example:
+
+```python
+class DriverCreateForm(UserCreationForm):
+    pass
+```
+
+Bad example:
+
+```python
+class DriverCreateForm(forms.ModelForm):
+    pass
+```
+
+2. Don't override `template_name`, `context_object_name` and so on if they are the same as default ones.
+
+## Code Style
+1. Make sure you've added a blank line at the end to all your files including `.css`, `.html` and `.gitignore`.
+2. Use `()` instead of `backslash — \` in if-statements.
+
+Good example:
+
+```python
+if (first_condition and second_condition 
+        and third_condition):
+    #  some actions
+```
+
+Also possible one:
+
+```python
+if (first_condition and
+    second_condition):
+    #  some actions
+```
+
+Bad example:
+
+```python
+if first_condition and second_condition \
+    and third_condition:
+    # some actions
+```
+
+3. Group imports using `()` if needed.
+
+Good example:
+
+```python
+from django.contrib.auth.mixins import (
+    LoginRequiredMixin, 
+    UserPassesTestMixin, 
+    PermissionRequiredMixin,
+)
+```
+
+Bad example:
+
+```python
+from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, \
+    UserPassesTestMixin, PermissionRequiredMixin
+```
+
+4. Use correct path names.
+
+Good example:
+
+```python
+path(
+    "manufacurers/create/", 
+    ManufacturerCreateView.as_view(), 
+    name="manufacturer-create"
+),
+```
+
+Bad example:
+
+```python
+path(
+    "manufacturers/manufacturer_create/", 
+    ManufacturerCreateView.as_view(), 
+    name="manufacturer-create"
+)
+```
+
+Another bad example:
+
+```python
+path("create/", ManufacturerCreateView.as_view(), name="manufacturer-create")
+```
+
+5. Add `Cancel` button apart from `Delete` one. The `Cancel` button will lead to the previous page the user was on.
+
+6. Make sure you use 2 whitespaces indentations in your `.html` files.
+
+## Clean Code
+Add comments, prints, and functions to check your solution when you write your code. 
+Don't forget to delete them when you are ready to commit and push your code.
