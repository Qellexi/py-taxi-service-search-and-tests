 In this task, you will implement a custom form and django built-in forms to create,
 update or delete content from the site.
 
+Since this task is the last step before deploying your project, 
+there is no fixture attached to this task, we strongly recommend that you fill it out yourself.

     - `Create`, `Update`, `Delete` views for `Car`,
